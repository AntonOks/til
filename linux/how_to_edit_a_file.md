# How to edit a file in linux

Simplest way to get started is to use `nano`. It's included in ubuntu.

    $ nano filename

nano is a clone of pico. pico also seems to be included. 

It's pretty intuitive. It all happens in the console. There is a list of commands at the foot of the terminal. 

|Keys|Purpose|
|Ctrl O|Write out... i.e. SAVE.|
|Ctrl W|Where is... i.e. find text|
|Ctrl X|Exit... It warns you if you try to exit without saving.|

Now ofcourse, vim is also available. It's far more powerful, but with a learning curve.

It will never ever go away as long as you live. So any effort spent learning it will continue to be of value forever.
