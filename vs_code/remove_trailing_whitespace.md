# Removing trailing whitespace

This is the biggie.

Any text editor can run custom tasks and do powerful things with regular expressions or how a rich plugin ecosystem....

But does it trim trailing whitespace, by default!?

From [SO: Remove trailing spaces automatically or with a shortcut](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30884131/remove-trailing-spaces-automatically-or-with-a-shortcut)

1. Open VS User Settings (`Preferences > User Settings`). 
This will open two side-by-side documents.

2. Add a new "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true setting to 
the User Settings document **on the right**. 

(This is so you aren't editing the Default Setting directly, but instead adding to it.)

Save the User Settings file.
