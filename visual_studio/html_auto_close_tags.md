# Auto Insert close tag

When I type <p> and it automatically inserts </p> .... I find that strangely annoying...
Probably because that is only helpful if you write in a linear manner, from beginnign to end... and I rarely do that.
I spent more time editing any file than I do writing it the first time.

So -- to turn off that behaviour:


go to:

    Tools | Options | Text Editor | HTML | Formatting

Under "Automatic formatting options"
    "Auto Insert close tag" <--- uncheck that!!
