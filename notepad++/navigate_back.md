# How to navigate back in Notepad++

In visual studio I use "Ctrl -" to move back to my previous location. And in Powershell I use "popd".

I wish there was an equivalent in Notepad++.

...and stackoverflow says:

> [Location Navigate (LocationNav)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/locationnav/) has hotkeys for moving backwards/forwards across both cursor positions and across source edits.
