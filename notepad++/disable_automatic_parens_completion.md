# Disable automatic parens completion.

Notepad++ has this annoying built in feature where it autocompletes quotes brackets angle brackets braces parens parentheses etc.

You type `"`  and it throws in another `"` right away! Stop it already!


> Settings -> Preferences -> Auto-Completion
>
> 2nd grouping called "Auto-Insert", check/un-check the appropriate auto completion/inserts.
