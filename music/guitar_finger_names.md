>In classical guitar technique, one uses four fingers: the fingertips and fingernails of the thumb and the index, middle and ring fingers. In guitar fingering diagrams, they are designated "p" (thumb), "i" (index), "m" (middle), and "a" (ring), from the names of the fingers in Spanish: pulgar, indice, medio, and anular.

In classical guitar, the thumb and first four fingers are indicated by the letters p, i, m, a -- from the Spanish names: pulgar, indice, medio, and anular.
