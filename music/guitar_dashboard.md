# Guitar Dashboard by Mike Hadlow

Mike Hadlow has created an awesome dashboard for understanding, learning and playing scales/modes on guitar.

His intro to using the tool is here:

and description of how it was created here:

This could be a more dynamic alternative to the [guitar shapes](guitar_shapes.md) posters I have on my wall.

I've now got this image:

## How to read the diagram above.

First ignore the circles. Pretend they're completely not present. All that's left are some note names in small black letters. 

The first diagram shows you the position of all the notes in Dorian, in this case in A. 

The author (mike hadlow) eschews the use of Roman numerals though, so instead of II and ii it says 2M and 2m.   

The notes that are circled are the notes of minor pentatonic. It's clear that pentatonic minor is a subset of Dorian. And if you know your pentatonic minor (like most guitarists) you'll see what you can add to pentatonic minor to get Dorian. 

The next diagram does the same for natural minor. (I already had a variation of this diagram on my wall) and the third does the same for Phrygian.
