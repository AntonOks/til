# Amateur Mistakes

To make a self-published book look like an amateur book, you don't have to break all these guidelines, any one will do.


## Page Layout

* gutter: odd-numbered pages, gutter on left; even-numbered pages, gutter on right

## Table of Content

## Chapters

* new chapter starts on a new page
* new chapters begin on the right hand side (i.e. on odd numbered pages)
* first page of chapter does not have a header
* first page of chapter has consistent spacing from top
* body text is serif font
* consistent style of chapter headings, including capitalization rules

## Content

* no spelling errors
* consistent capitalization
* consistent punctuation

## Images

* images at high DPI, e.g. 300.

## Cover

* cover image has spine at correct width (spine-width depends on the number of interior-pages, thickness of paper, etc.); an amateur book might end up with a cover design where the spine is ill-fitted.
* spine: direction of text is consistent with the majority of books on your shelf
