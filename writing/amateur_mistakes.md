# Amateur Mistakes

To make a self-published book look like an amateur book, you don't have to break *all* these guidelines, any *one* will do.


## Page Layout

* gutter: odd-numbered pages, gutter on left; even-numbered pages, gutter on right.
* margins: the usual thing in an amateur book is to have these too cramped.

<!-- TODO: Gutter picture -->


## Table of Contents


## Chapters

 * new chapter starts on a new page
 * new chapters begin on the right hand side (i.e. on odd-numbered pages) 
 * first page of chapter does not have a header
 * first page of chapter has consistent spacing from top
 * body text is serif font
 * consistent style of chapter headings, including capitalization rules, see [Title Case Converter](https://titlecaseconverter.com/)
 * pay attention to kerning of headings
 * orphan lines, orphan words

## Content

 * no spelling errors
 * consistent punctuation -- see [the punctuation guide](https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/)
 * consistent use of terminology
 * ensure typographic characters other than regular English letters are printed correctly. e.g. &eacute; (So many different ways these can fail)
 * fonts for body content should be Serif fonts

> The most widely used typefaces for book body text include Baskerville, Bembo, Garamond, Janson, Palatino, and Times Roman (although this more of a newspaper font). Sans serif fonts may be difficult to read for an entire book.
>
> If using a serif font for body text (Berkeley, Palatino, Garamond, etc.), do not use smaller than 10pt. size

 * paragraph style: line-height (leading) is not too cramped and not too spacious
 * alignment: justified.
 
 


## Separators



## Images

 * images at high DPI, e.g. 300.

## Exterior (cover)


<!-- TODO: picture: interior file, exterior file -->

 * exterior image has spine at correct width (spine-width depends on the number of interior-pages, thickness of paper, etc.); an amateur book might end up with a cover design where the spine is ill-fitted.
 * spine: direction of text is consistent with the majority of books on your shelf, i.e. text flows top to bottom. When looking at the book on the shelf you lower your right ear to your shoulder to read the spines.
