by Charles Duhigg

This is a well researched and creatively written book. Charles is a journalist who knows how to "craft" a story for high impact. The topic is powerful.


## PART 1: THE HABITS OF INDIVIDUALS

### Chapter 1: The Habit Loop – How Habits Work

Trigger - Action - Reward.

Once a habit is established, the higher functions and memory are not involved at all. It occurs deep in the brain, close to the brain stem, in the bassal ganglia.

The trigger can be something tiny. e.g. You have a moment of boredom.
The action is the thing itself, e.g. you smoke a cigarette.
The reward is the payoff, e.g. you're not bored, and your brain gets a little buzz.

Once that's repeated, a habit becomes ingrained, and you don't consciously think about doing the thing. You just do it.


### Chapter 2: The Craving Brain – How to Create New Habits

When the reward occurs, the brain has a little burst of activity (possibly dopamine release).

Once the habit is established, the brain will give this dopamine release in anticipation of the reward itself. At that point the habit is a craving. If the reward doesn't arrive, you'll be angry and upset. 

### Chapter 3: The Golden Rule of Habit Change – Why Transformation Occurs

The golden rule is that you can't eradicate the loop (Trigger-Action-Reward). But you can modify it. E.g. swap in a different action, but try to keep the reward the same. 

The reward isn't the obvious reward: e.g. crave cigarette, only nicotine will provide the reward. The reward might just be overcoming the boredom of the moment. Finding a tiny pocket of excitement during a dull moment.
