## Guidelines

 * Should be factoids that you expect to need to refer to again.
 * Hence, any factoid that is "Well that's interesting!" but would *never* be referenced again, are NOT wanted here.
 * So they mostly end up being technical things.
 * The folder structure means things are categorised by ONE main topic, not tagged with endless topics/subtopics.
