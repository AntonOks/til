#Today I Learned



This is a place where I've started storing short descriptions of things I learn.

## Guidelines

Should be factoids that you expect to need to refer to again. Hence, any factoid that is "Well that's interesting!" but would *never* be referenced again is NOT wanted here. So they mostly end up being technical things (though the [concepts](concepts/01_summary.md) category is a major exception).

The folder structure means things are categorised by ONE main topic, not tagged with endless topics/subtopics.
