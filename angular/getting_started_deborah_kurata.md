# Getting Started with Angular (Deborah Kurata)


These are my study notes for the coure [Angular: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-getting-started-update/table-of-contents) from Deborah Kurata, on pluralsight.

The course duration is 5h43m.


Angular is javascript framework for building client side applications.

Composed of "Components". Components are put together into modules. 

There is always at least 1 module, the Angular root module.
