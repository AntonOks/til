# Mere Exposure

If you see something often enough you begin to think it is as it should be.

Even if you've only seen something one time, you think it's better than a thing you've seen zero times.

Example. If you put Donald Trump on reality tv, next thing he'll end up being put nominated for as a presidential candidate.
