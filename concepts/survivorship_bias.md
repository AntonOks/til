#Survivorship Bias.

An example of a selection bias.

You don't get the opportunity to gather evidence from the "non-survivors". Hence the evidence you do see is wildly tainted.

e.g

"The advice business is a monopoly run by survivors. When something becomes a non-survivor, it is either completely eliminated, or whatever voice it has is muted to zero."

We discount the role of luck.

If enough scientists study a phenomenon, some will find statistically significant results by chance, and these are the experiments submitted for publication. Additionally, papers showing positive results may be more appealing to editors.
