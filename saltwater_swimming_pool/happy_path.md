# The happy path

If all is going well with your saltwater swimming pool you will still need to regularly add:

1. water
2. salt
3. hydrochloric acid
4. uric acid

And you will need to regularly:

1. empty the baskets
2. test the pool
3. backwash the filter
4. rinse the filter
5. de-calcify the chlorinator


You will need to perform a lot more maintenance in summer than winter.



And when things go wrong you may need to add:

1. chlorine (aka shock)
2. alkaline (aka buffer)
3. phosphate remover (aka starver)
4. (aka clarifier)
5. Flocculant
