# Getting started with electron

What is it?

> Electron enables you to create desktop applications with pure JavaScript by providing a runtime with rich native (operating system) APIs. You could see it as a variant of the Node.js runtime that is focused on desktop applications instead of web servers.

Get started as easy as

    # Clone the Quick Start repository
    > git clone https://github.com/atom/electron-quick-start

    # Go into the repository
    > cd electron-quick-start

    # Install the dependencies and run
    > npm install; npm start

(This assumes you have [git](../git/01_summary.md) and [npm](../npm/01_summary.md).)

Next, follow the quick start tutorial...
